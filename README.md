**Sunbase Coding Assignment**
-----------------------------
**What does the app do?**
- It's a simple customer management app. It fetches customer details from third-party API, saves in local DB and presents the data on the client side.
- It generates an authorization token to fetch the data from the remote API. The authorization token is generated by the customer data provider (sunbase.com in this case).
- It provides basic functionalities to the user such as adding new customers to DB, updating and deleting a customer and searching on various parameters.

**How to Run the App**
- Once you have pulled the code, there are three things you need to do to run the app seamlessly.
- 1st, the app uses MySQL database so create a database named "sunbasedata" in your MySQL database.
- 2nd, configure the database settings in the Application.properties file. Just replace the data source username and password with your MySQL username and password.
- 3rd, Keep your port running on 8080.
- Once all these set-ups have been made and the app is up and running, access the client side on http://localhost:8080/index.html

Happy coding.
